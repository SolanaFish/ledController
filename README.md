# ledController

Small arduino project for controlling rgb led strips with style

## Project info

For now this is just a small arduino project aiming, to build an arduino leonardo based led controller, with lots of additional features.

## Plans

* 3 rotary encoders for controlling led strips color, brightness, and sound volume.
* 3 push buttons for controlling led mode, turning on pc, and controlling room lights
* 2 double pole single throw switches - 1 for turning on and off the controller, and led's, and 1 for controlling lights
* I am aiming to fit whole controller (with arduino, but without the power supply) into a small 20cm X 20cm x 4cm wooden box, and use concrete knobs for encoders, so space will be rally limited.
* Hardware for the project has to be cheaper than $25 (including led strip and arduino, but not including old pc power supply)
